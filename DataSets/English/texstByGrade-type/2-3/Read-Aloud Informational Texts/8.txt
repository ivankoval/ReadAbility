“Feline Tracks”
Of all the larger predators, wildcats are the most likely to use the same trails again and again. In deep snow, their
habitual routes become gully trails in which the feline tracks going to and coming from their hunting grounds are
preserved, down out of the wind, away from blowing snow.
A cat’s sharp retractable claws do not show in its track unless the cat has lunged to catch its prey or scratched the
ground to cover its droppings. Only cats thoroughly cover their droppings.
Bobcat, lion, and jaguar paws all have three-lobed heels. The lynx, the ocelot, and the jaguarondi have single lobedheels.
The wildcats we have in North America are, from the smallest to the largest: ocelot, jaguarondi, bobcat, lynx, American
lion, and jaguar.
