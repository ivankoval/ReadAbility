Fitzgerald, F. Scott. The Great Gatsby. New York: Scribner, 2000. (1925)
From Chapter 3
There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and
went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched
his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week ends his Rolls-Royce became an
omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station
wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener,
toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers and garden shears, repairing the ravages of the
night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges
and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could
extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s
thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored
lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors
d’oeuvres, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to
a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials
so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
