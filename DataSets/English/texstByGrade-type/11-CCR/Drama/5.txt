Miller, Arthur. Death of a Salesman. New York: Viking, 1996. (1949)
From Act II
Willy: Oh, yeah, my father lived many years in Alaska. He was an adventurous man. We’ve got quite a little streak of
self-reliance in our family. I thought I’d go out with my older brother and try to locate him, and maybe settle in the
North with the old man. And I was almost decided to go, when I met a salesman in the Parker House. His name was
Dave Singleman. And he was eighty-four years old, and he’d drummed merchandise in thirty-one states. And old
Dave, he’d go up to his room, y’understand, put on his green velvet slippers—I’ll never forget—and pick up his phone
and call the buyers, and without ever leaving is room, at the age of eighty-four, he made his living. And when I saw
that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. ‘Cause what could be more satisfying than to be
able to go, at the age of eighty-four, into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone, and be remembered
and loved and helped by so many different people? Do you know? When he died—and by the way he died the death
of a salesman, in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, going into Boston—
when he died, hundreds of salesmen and buyers were at his funeral. Things were sad on a lotta trains for months
after that. He stands up. Howard has not looked at him. In those days there was personality in it, Howard. There was
respect, and comradeship, and gratitude in it. Today, it’s all cut and dried, and there’s no chance for bringing friendship
to bear—or personality. You see what I mean? They don’t know me anymore.
