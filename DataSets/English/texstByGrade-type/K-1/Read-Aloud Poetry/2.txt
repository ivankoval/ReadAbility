Over in the meadow in a new little hive
Lived an old mother queen bee and her honeybees five.
“Hum,” said the mother,
“We hum,” said the five;
So they hummed and were glad in their new little hive.
Over in the meadow in a dam built of sticks
Lived an old mother beaver and her little beavers six.
“Build,” said the mother,
“We build,” said the six;
So they built and were glad in the dam built of sticks.
Over in the meadow in the green wet bogs
Lived an old mother froggie and her seven polliwogs.
“Swim,” said the mother.
“We swim,” said the ‘wogs;
So they swam and were glad in the green wet bogs.
Over in the meadow as the day grew late
Lived an old mother owl and her little owls eight.
“Wink,” said the mother,
“We wink,” said the eight;
So they winked and were glad as the day grew late.
