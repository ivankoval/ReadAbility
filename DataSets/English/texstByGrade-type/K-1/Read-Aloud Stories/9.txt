When they got hot, they sat under a tree with Papá Grande. “Tell us the story about the man in the forest,” said
Tomás.
Tomás liked to listen to Papá Grande tell stories in Spanish. Papá Grande was the best storyteller in the family.
“En un tiempo pasado,” Papá Grande began. “Once upon a time…on a windy night a man was riding a horse through a
forest. The wind was howling, whoooooooo, and the leaves were blowing, whish, whish…
“All of a sudden something grabbed the man. He couldn’t move. He was too scared to look around. All night long he
wanted to ride away. But he couldn’t.
“How the wind howled, whoooooooo. How the leaves blew. How his teeth chattered!
“Finally the sun came up. Slowly the man turned around. And who do you think was holding him?
Tomás smiled and said, “A thorny tree.”
Papá Grande laughed. “Tomás, you know all my stories,” he said. “There are many more in the library. You are big
enough to go by yourself. Then you can teach us new stories.”
The next morning Tomás walked downtown. He looked at the big library. Its tall windows were like eyes glaring at him.
Tomás walked all around the big building. He saw children coming out carrying books. Slowly he started climbing up,
up the steps. He counted them to himself in Spanish. Uno, dos, tres, cuatro…His mouth felt full of cotton.
Tomás stood in front of the library doors. He pressed his nose against the glass and peeked in. The library was huge!
