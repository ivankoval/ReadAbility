From “Two Big Bears”
The Story of Pa and the Bear in the Way
When I went to town yesterday with the furs I found it hard walking in the soft snow. It took me a long time to get
to town, and other men with furs had come in earlier to do their trading. The storekeeper was busy, and I had to wait
until he could look at my furs.
Then we had to bargain about the price of each one, and then I had to pick out the things I wanted to take in trade.
So it was nearly sundown before I could start home.
I tried to hurry, but the walking was hard and I was tired, so I had not gone far before night came. And I was alone in
the Big Woods without my gun.
There were still six miles to walk, and I came along as fast as I could. The night grew darker and darker, and I wished
for my gun, because I knew that some of the bears had come out of their winter dens. I had seen their tracks when I
went to town in the morning.
Bears are hungry and cross at this time of year; you know they have been sleeping in their dens all winter long with
nothing to eat, and that makes them thin and angry when they wake up. I did not want to meet one.
I hurried along as quick as I could in the dark. By and by the stars gave a little light. It was still black as pitch where
the woods were thick, but in the open places I could see, dimly. I could see the snowy road ahead a little way, and I
could see the dark woods standing all around me. I was glad when I came into an open place where the stars gave me
this faint light.
All the time I was watching, as well as I could, for bears. I was listening for the sounds they make when they go carelessly
through the bushes.
Then I came again into an open place, and there, right in the middle of my road, I saw a big black bear.
