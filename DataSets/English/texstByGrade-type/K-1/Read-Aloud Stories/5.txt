Once, oh small children round my knee, there were no stories on earth to hear. All the stories belonged to Nyame, the
Sky God. He kept them in a golden box next to his royal stool.
Ananse, the Spider Man, wanted to buy the Sky God’s stories. So he spun a web up to the sky.
When the Sky God heard what Ananse wanted, he laughed: “Twe, twe, twe. The price of my stories is that you bring
me Osebo the leopard of-the-terrible-teeth, Mmboro the hornet who-stings-like-fire, and Mmoatia the fairy whommen-
never-see.”
Ananse bowed and answered: “I shall gladly pay the price.”
“Twe, twe, twe,” chuckled the Sky God. “How can a weak old man like you, so small, so small, so small, pay my price?”
But Ananse merely climbed down to earth to find the things that the Sky God demanded.
Ananse ran along the jungle path – yiridi, yiridi, yiridi – till he came to Osebo the leopard-of-the-terrible-teeth.
“Oho, Ananse,” said the leopard, “you are just in time to be my lunch.”
Ananse replied: “As for that, what will happen will happen. But first let us play the binding binding game.”
The leopard, who was fond of games, asked: “How is it played?”
“With vine creepers,” explained Ananse. “I will bind you by your foot and foot. Then I will untie you, and you can tie
me up.”
“Very well,” growled the leopard, who planned to eat Ananse as soon as it was his turn to bind him.
So Ananse tied the leopard
by his foot
by his foot
by his foot
by his foot, with the vine creeper.
Then he said: “Now, Osebo, you are ready to meet the Sky God.” And he hung the tied leopard in a tree in the jungle.
