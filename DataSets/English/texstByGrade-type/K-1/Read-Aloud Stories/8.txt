From “The Fair in Reynosa”
My friends and I once went to a very big fair across the border in Reynosa, Mexico. The fair lasted a whole week.
Artisans and entertainers came from all over Mexico. There were lots of booths with food and crafts. This is one little
section where everybody is ordering and eating tacos.
I painted a father buying tacos and the rest of the family sitting down at the table. The little girl is the father’s favorite
and that’s why she gets to tag along with him. I can always recognize little girls who are their fathers’ favorites.
From “Birthday Party”
That’s me hitting the piñata at my sixth birthday party. It was also my brother’s fourth birthday. My mother made a
big birthday party for us and invited all kinds of friends, cousins and neighborhood kids.
You can’t see the piñata when you’re trying to hit it, because your eyes are covered with a handkerchief. My father
is pulling the rope that makes the piñata go up and down. He will make sure that everybody has a chance to hit it at
least once. Somebody will end up breaking it, and that’s when all the candies will fall out and all the kids will run and
try to grab them.
