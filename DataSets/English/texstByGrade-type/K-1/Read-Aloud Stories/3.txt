From Chapter 1: “Stillwater”
It was an afternoon in late September. In the pleasant little city of Stillwater, Mr. Popper, the house painter was going
home from work.
He was carrying his buckets, his ladders, and his boards so that he had rather a hard time moving along. He was spattered
here and there with paint and calcimine, and there were bits of wallpaper clinging to his hair and whiskers, for
he was rather an untidy man.
The children looked up from their play to smile at him as he passed, and the housewives, seeing him, said, “Oh dear,
there goes Mr. Popper. I must remember to ask John to have the house painted over in the spring.”
No one knew what went on inside of Mr.Popper’s head, and no one guessed that he would one day be the most famous
person in Stillwater.
He was a dreamer. Even when he was busiest smoothing down the paste on the wallpaper, or painting the outside of
other people’s houses, he would forget what he was doing. Once he had painted three sides of a kitchen green, and
the other side yellow. The housewife, instead of being angry and making him do it over, had liked it so well that she
had made him leave it that way. And all the other housewives, when they saw it, admired it too, so that pretty soon
everybody in Stillwater had two-colored kitchens.
The reason Mr. Popper was so absent-minded was that he was always dreaming about far-away countries. He had
never been out of Stillwater. Not that he was unhappy. He had a nice little house of his own, a wife whom he loved
dearly, and two children, named Janie and Bill. Still, it would have been nice, he often thought, if he could have seen
something of the world before he met Mrs. Popper and settled down. He had never hunted tigers in India, or climbed
the peaks of the Himalayas, or dived for pearls in the South Seas. Above all, he had never seen the Poles.
