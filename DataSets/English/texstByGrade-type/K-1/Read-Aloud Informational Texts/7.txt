When spring winds warm the earth, a farmer plants hundreds of pumpkin seeds.
Every pumpkin seed can become a baby pumpkin plant. Underground, covered with dark, moist soil, the baby plants
begin to grow.
As the plants get bigger, the seeds crack open. Stems sprout up. Roots dig down. Inside the roots are tubes. Water
travels up these tubes the way juice goes up a straw.
In less than two weeks from planting time, green shoots poke up through the earth.
These shoots grow into tiny seedlings. Two leaves, called seed leaves, uncurl on each stem. They reach up toward
the sun.
Sunlight gives these leaves energy to make food. Like us, plants need food to grow. But green plants do not eat food
as we do. Their leaves make it.
To make food, plants need light, water, and air. Leaves catch the sunlight. Roots soak up rainwater. And little openings
in the leaves let air in. Using energy from the sun, the leaves mix the air with water from the soil to make sugar.
This feeds the plant.
Soon broad, prickly leaves with jagged edges unfold on the stems.
The seed leaves dry up. Now the new leaves make food for the pumpkin plant.
Each pumpkin stem has many sets of tubes. One tube in each set takes water from the soil up to the leaves so they
can make sugar. The other tube in each set sends food back down so the pumpkin can grow.
The days grow warmer. The farmer tends the pumpkin patch to keep weeds out. Weeds take water from the soil.
Pumpkin plants need that water to grow.
