From Act Two
BERENGER: [coming in] Hello Jean!
JEAN: [in bed] What time is it? Aren’t you at the office?
BERENGER: You’re still in bed; you’re not at the office, then? Sorry if I’m disturbing you.
JEAN: [still with his back turned] Funny, I didn’t recognize your voice.
BERENGER: I didn’t recognize yours either.
JEAN: [still with his back turned] Sit down!
BERENGER: Aren’t you feeling well?
[JEAN replies with a grunt.]
You know, Jean, it was stupid of me to get so upset yesterday over a thing like that.
JEAN: A thing like what?
BERENGER: Yesterday ...
JEAN: When yesterday? Where yesterday?
BERENGER: Don’t you remember? It was about that wretched rhinoceros.
JEAN: What rhinoceros?
BERENGER: The rhinoceros, or rather, the two wretched rhinoceroses we saw.
JEAN: Oh yes, I remember ... How do you know they were wretched?
BERENGER: Oh I just said that.
JEAN: Oh. Well let’s not talk any more about it.
BERENGER: That’s very nice of you.
JEAN: Then that’s that.
BERENGER: But I would like to say how sorry I am for being so insistent ... and so obstinate ... and getting so angry ...
in fact ... I acted stupidly.
JEAN: That’s not surprising with you.
BERENGER: I’m very sorry.
JEAN: I don’t feel very well. [He coughs.]
BERENGER: That’s probably why you’re in bed. [With a change of tone:] You know, Jean, as it turned out, we were
both right.
JEAN: What about?
BERENGER: About ... well, you know, the same thing. Sorry to bring it up again, but I’ll only mention it briefly. I just
wanted you to know that in our different ways we were both right. It’s been proved now. There are some rhinoceroses
in the town with two horns and some with one.
