Olsen, Tillie. “I Stand Here Ironing.” Tell Me a Riddle. New York: Dell, 1956. (1956)
From “I Stand Here Ironing”
I stand here ironing, and what you asked me moves tormented back and forth with the iron.
“I wish you would manage the time to come in and talk with me about your daughter. I’m sure you can help me understand
her. She’s a youngster who needs help and whom I’m deeply interested in helping.”
“Who needs help”…Even if I came, what good would it do? You think because I am her mother I have a key, or that in
some way you could use me as a key? She has lived for nineteen years. There is all that like that has happened outside
of me, beyond me.
And when is there time to remember, to sift, to weigh, to estimate, to total? I will start and there will be an interruption
and I will have to gather it all together again. Or I will become engulfed with all I did or did not do, with what
should have been and what cannot be helped.
She was a beautiful baby. The first and only one of our five that was beautiful at birth. You do not guess how new and
uneasy her tenancy in her now-loveliness. You did not know her all those years she was thought homely, or see her
peering over her baby pictures, making me tell her over and over how beautiful she had been—and would be, I would
tell her—and was now, to the seeing eye. But the seeing eyes were few or non-existent. Including mine.
