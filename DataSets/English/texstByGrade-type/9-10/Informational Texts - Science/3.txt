The birth began in a young star. A young star is a mass of hydrogen nuclei. Because the star is hot (about thirteen
million degrees at the center), the nuclei cannot hold on to their electrons. The electrons wander around. The nuclei
of hydrogen—that is, the protons—are moving about very fast too. From time to time one proton runs headlong into
another. When this happens, one of the protons loses its electric charge and changes into a neutron. The pair then
cling together as a single nucleus of heavy hydrogen. This nucleus will in time capture another proton. Now there is a
nucleus with two protons and one neutron, called light helium. When two of these nuclei smash into each other, two
protons are expelled in the process. This creates a nucleus of helium with two protons and two neutrons.
This is the fundamental process of fusion by which the primitive hydrogen of the universe is built up into a new basic
material, helium. In this process, energy is given off in the form of heat and light that make the stars shine. It is the
first stage in the birth of the heavier atoms.
