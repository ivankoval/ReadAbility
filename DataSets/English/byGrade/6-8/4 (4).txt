Navajo tradition. “Twelfth Song of Thunder.” The Mountain Chant: A Navajo Ceremony. Forgotten Books, 2008.
(1887)
The voice that beautifies the land!
The voice above,
The voice of thunder
Within the dark cloud
Again and again it sounds,
The voice that beautifies the land.
The voice that beautifies the land!
The voice below,
The voice of the grasshopper
Among the plants
Again and again it sounds,
The voice that beautifies the land.
