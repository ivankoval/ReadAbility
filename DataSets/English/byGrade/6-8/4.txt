From Chapter 3: “Six Years Old”
By the time Harriet Ross was six years old, she had unconsciously absorbed many kinds of knowledge, almost with
the air she breathed. She could not, for example, have said how or at what moment she knew that she was a slave.
She knew that her brothers and sisters, her father and mother, and all the other people who lived in the quarter, men,
women and children were slaves.
She had been taught to say, “Yes, Missus,” “No, Missus,” to white women, “Yes, Mas’r,” “No, Mas’r” to white men. Or,
“Yes, sah,” “No, sah.”
At the same time someone had taught her where to look for the North Star, the star that stayed constant, not rising in
the east and setting in the west as the other stars appeared to do; and told her that anyone walking toward the North
could use that star as a guide.
She knew about fear, too. Sometimes at night, or during the day, she heard the furious galloping of horses, not just
one horse, several horses, thud of the hoofbeats along the road, jingle of harness. She saw the grown folks freeze into
stillness, not moving, scarcely breathing, while they listened. She could not remember who first told her that those
furious hoofbeats meant that patrollers were going in pursuit of a runaway. Only the slaves said patterollers, whispering
the word.
