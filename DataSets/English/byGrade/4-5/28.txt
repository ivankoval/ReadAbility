Come, words, come in your every color.
I’ll toss you in storm or breeze.
I’ll say, say, say you,
Taste you sweet as plump plums,
bitter as old lemons,
I’ll sniff you, words, warm
as almonds or tart as apple-red,
feel you green
and soft as new grass,
lightweight as dandelion plumes,
or thorngray as cactus,
heavy as black cement,
cold blue as icicles,
warm as abuelita’s yellowlap.
I’ll hear you, words, loud as searoar’s
Purple crash, hushed
as gatitos curled in sleep,
as the last goldlullaby.
I’ll see you long and dark as tunnels,
bright as rainbows,
playful as chestnutwind.
I’ll watch you, words, rise and dance and spin.
I’ll say, say, say you
in English,
in Spanish,
I’ll find you.
Hold you.
Toss you.
I’m free too.
I say yo soy libre,
I am free
free, free,
free as confetti.
