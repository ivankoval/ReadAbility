From “The Making of a Hurricane”
Great whirling storms roar out of the oceans in many parts of the world. They are called by several names—hurricane,
typhoon, and cyclone are the three most familiar ones. But no matter what they are called, they are all the same sort
of storm. They are born in the same way, in tropical waters. They develop the same way, feeding on warm, moist air.
And they do the same kind of damage, both ashore and at sea. Other storms may cover a bigger area or have higher
winds, but none can match both the size and the fury of hurricanes. They are earth’s mightiest storms.
Like all storms, they take place in the atmosphere, the envelope of air that surrounds the earth and presses on its
surface. The pressure at any one place is always changing. There are days when air is sinking and the atmosphere
presses harder on the surface. These are the times of high pressure. There are days when a lot of air is rising and the
atmosphere does not press down as hard. These are times of low pressure. Low-pressure areas over warm oceans
give birth to hurricanes.
