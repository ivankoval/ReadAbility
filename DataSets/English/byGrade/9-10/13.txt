Quindlen, Anna. “A Quilt of a Country.” Newsweek September 27, 2001. (2001)
America is an improbable idea. A mongrel nation built of ever-changing disparate parts, it is held together by a notion,
the notion that all men are created equal, though everyone knows that most men consider themselves better
than someone. “Of all the nations in the world, the United States was built in nobody’s image,” the historian Daniel
Boorstin wrote. That’s because it was built of bits and pieces that seem discordant, like the crazy quilts that have
been one of its great folk-art forms, velvet and calico and checks and brocades. Out of many, one. That is the ideal.
