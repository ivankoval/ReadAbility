From “Master Harold”…and the boys
Sam: Of course it is. That’s what I’ve been trying to say to you all afternoon. And it’s beautiful because that is what
we want life to be like. But instead, like you said, Hally, we’re bumping into each other all the time. Look at the three
of us this afternoon: I’ve bumped into Willie, the two of us have bumped into you, you’ve bumped into your mother,
she bumping into your Dad. . . . None of us knows the steps and there’s no music playing. And it doesn’t stop with us.
The whole world is doing it all the time. Open a newspaper and what do you read? America has bumped into Russia,
England is bumping into India, rich man bumps into poor man. Those are big collisions, Hally. They make for a lot of
bruises. People get hurt in all that bumping, and we’re sick and tired of it now. It’s been going on for too long. Are we
never going to get it right? . . . Learn to dance life like champions instead of always being just a bunch of beginners at
it?
Hally: (Deep and sincere admiration of the man) You’ve got a vision, Sam!
Sam: Not just me. What I’m saying to you is that everybody’s got it. That’s why there’s only standing room left for the
Centenary Hall in two weeks’ time. For as long as the music lasts, we are going to see six couples get it right, the way
we want life to be.
Hally: But is that the best we can do, Sam . . . watch six finalists dreaming about the way it should be?
Sam: I don’t know. But it starts with that. Without the dream we won’t know what we’re going for. And anyway I
reckon there are a few people who have got past just dreaming about it and are trying for something real. Remember
that thing we read once in the paper about the Mahatma Gandhi? Going without food to stop those riots in India?
