From “Something in the Forest”
1980 New Year’s Day
Charles Monet was a loner. He was a Frenchman who live by himself in a little wooden bungalow on the private lands
of the Nzoia Sugar Factory, a plantation in western Kenya that spread along the Nzoiz Rover within sight of Mount
Elgon, a huge, solitary, extinct volcano that rises to a height of fourteen thousand feet near the edge of the Rift Valley.
Monet’s history is a little obscure. As with so many expatriates who end up in Africa, it is not clear what brought him
there. Perhaps he had been in some kind of trouble in France. Or perhaps he had been drawn to Kenya by the beauty
of the country. He was an amateur naturalist, fond of birds and animals but not of humanity in general. He was fiftysix
years old, of medium height and medium build with smooth, straight brown hair; a good-looking man. It seems
that his only close friends were women who lived in towns around the mountain, yet even they could not recall much
about him for the doctors who investigated his death. His job was to take care of the sugar factory’s water-pumping
machinery, which drew water from the Nzoia River and delivered it to many miles of sugar-cane fields. They say that
he spent most of his day inside the pump house by the river as if it pleased him to watch and listen to the machines
doing their work.
