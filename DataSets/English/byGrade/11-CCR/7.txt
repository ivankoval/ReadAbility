Soyinka, Wole. Death and the King’s Horseman: A Play. New York: W. W. Norton, 2002. (1976)
From Act I, Scene 1
ELESIN:
Where the storm pleases, and when, it directs
The giants of the forest. When friendship summons
Is when the true comrade goes.
WOMEN:
Nothing will hold you back?
ELESIN:
Nothing. What! Has no one told you yet?
I go to keep my friend and master company.
Who says the mouth does not believe in
‘No, I have chewed all that before?’ I say I have.
The world is not a constant honey-pot.
