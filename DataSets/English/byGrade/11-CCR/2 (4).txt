From “The Three Rules of Epidemics”
The three rules of the Tipping Point—the Law of the few, the Stickiness Factor, the Power of Context—offer a way of
making sense of epidemics. They provide us with direction for how to go about reaching a Tipping Point. The balance
of this book will take these ideas and apply them to other puzzling situations and epidemics from the world around
us. How do these three rules help us understand teenage smoking, for example, or the phenomenon of word of
mouth, or crime, or the rise of a bestseller? The answers may surprise you.
