Emily: (softly, more in wonder than in grief) I can’t bear it. They’re so young and beautiful. Why did they ever have
to get old? Mama, I’m here. I’m grown up. I love you all, everything.— I cant look at everything hard enough. (pause,
talking to her mother who does not hear her. She speaks with mounting urgency) Oh, Mama, just look at me one minute
as though you really saw me. Mama, fourteen years have gone by. I’m dead. You’re a grandmother, Mama. I married
George Gibbs, Mama. Wally’s dead, too. Mama, his appendix burst on a camping trip to North Conway. We felt
just terrible about it - don’t you remember? But, just for a moment now we’re all together. Mama, just for a moment
we’re happy. Let’s look at one another. (pause, looking desperate because she has received no answer. She speaks in
a loud voice, forcing herself to not look at her mother) I can’t. I can’t go on. It goes so fast. We don’t have time to look
at one another. (she breaks down sobbing, she looks around) I didn’t realize. All that was going on in life and we never
noticed. Take me back - up the hill - to my grave. But first: Wait! One more look. Good-by, Good-by, world. Good-by,
Grover’s Corners? Mama and Papa. Good-bye to clocks ticking? and Mama’s sunflowers. And food and coffee. And
new-ironed dresses and hot baths? and sleeping and waking up. Oh, earth, you’re too wonderful for anybody to realize
you. (she asks abruptly through her tears) Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it? - every, every
minute? (she sighs) I’m ready to go back. I should have listened to you. That’s all human beings are! Just blind people.
