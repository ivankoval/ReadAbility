The accelerating pace of technological progress means that our intelligent creations will soon eclipse us—and that
their creations will eventually eclipse them.
Sometime early in this century the intelligence of machines will exceed that of humans. Within a quarter of a century,
machines will exhibit the full range of human intellect, emotions and skills, ranging from musical and other creative
aptitudes to physical movement. They will claim to have feelings and, unlike today’s virtual personalities, will be very
convincing when they tell us so. By around 2020 a $1,000 computer will at least match the processing power of the
human brain. By 2029 the software for intelligence will have been largely mastered, and the average personal computer
will be equivalent to 1,000 brains.
Once computers achieve a level of intelligence comparable to that of humans, they will necessarily soar past it. For
example, if I learn French, I can’t readily download that learning to you. The reason is that for us, learning involves
successions of stunningly complex patterns of interconnections among brain cells (neurons) and among the concentrations
of biochemicals known as neurotransmitters that enable impulses to travel from neuron to neuron. We have
no way of quickly downloading these patterns. But quick downloading will allow our nonbiological creations to share
immediately what they learn with billions of other machines. Ultimately, nonbiological entities will master not only the
sum total of their own knowledge but all of ours as well.
