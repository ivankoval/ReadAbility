It is spring in McAllen, Texas. The morning sun is warm. The streets are lined with palm trees and pickup trucks. McAllen
is in Hidalgo County, which has the lowest household income in the country, but it’s a border town, and a thriving
foreign-trade zone has kept the unemployment rate below ten per cent. McAllen calls itself the Square Dance Capital
of the World. “Lonesome Dove” was set around here.
McAllen has another distinction, too: it is one of the most expensive health-care markets in the country. Only Miami—
which has much higher labor and living costs—spends more per person on health care. In 2006, Medicare spent fifteen
thousand dollars per enrollee here, almost twice the national average. The income per capita is twelve thousand
dollars. In other words, Medicare spends three thousand dollars more per person here than the average person earns.
The explosive trend in American medical costs seems to have occurred here in an especially intense form. Our country’s
health care is by far the most expensive in the world. In Washington, the aim of health-care reform is not just to
extend medical coverage to everybody but also to bring costs under control. Spending on doctors, hospitals, drugs,
and the like now consumes more than one of every six dollars we earn. The financial burden has damaged the global
competitiveness of American businesses and bankrupted millions of families, even those with insurance. It’s also
devouring our government. “The greatest threat to America’s fiscal health is not Social Security,” President Barack
Obama said in a March speech at the White House. “It’s not the investments that we’ve made to rescue our economy
during this crisis. By a wide margin, the biggest threat to our nation’s balance sheet is the skyrocketing cost of health
care. It’s not even close.”
