Tagore, Rabindranath. “Song VII.” The Complete Text of Rabindranath Tagore’s Gitanjali: Text and Critical
Evaluation by S. K. Paul. Translated by Rabindranath Tagore. New Dehli: Sarup and Sons, 2006. (1913)
My song has put off her adornments.
She has no pride of dress and decoration.
Ornaments would mar our union;
they would come between thee and me;
their jingling would drown thy whispers.
My poet’s vanity dies in shame before thy sight.
O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet.
Only let me make my life simple and straight,
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.
