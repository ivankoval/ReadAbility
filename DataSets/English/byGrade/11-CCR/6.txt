From Act III
BENEATHA: He’s no brother of mine.
MAMA: What you say?
BENEATHA: I said that that individual is that room is no brother of mine.
MAMA: That’s what I thought you said. You feeling like you better than he is today? [BENEATHA does not answer.]
Yes? What you tell him a minute ago? That he wasn’t a man? Yes? You give him up for me? You done wrote his epitaph
too—like the rest of the world? Well who give you the privilege?
BENEATHA: Be on my side for once! You say what he just did, Mama! You saw him—down on his knees. Wasn’t it you
who taught me—to despise any man who would do that. Do what he’s going to do.
MAMA: Yes—I taught you that. Me and your daddy. But I thought I taught you something else too…I thought I taught
you to love him.
BENEATHA: Love him? There is nothing left to love.
MAMA: There is always something left to love. And if you ain’t learned that you ain’t learned nothing. [Looking at her.]
Have you cried for that boy today? I don’t mean for yourself and for the family ‘cause we lost the money. I mean for
him; what he been through and what it done to him. Child, when do you think is the time to love somebody the most;
when they done good and made things easy for everybody? Well then, you ain’t through learning—because that ain’t
the time at all. It’s when he’s at him lowest and can’t believe in hisself ‘cause the world done whipped him so. When
you starts measuring somebody, measure him right, child, measure him right. Make sure you done taken into account
what hills and valleys he come through before he got to wherever he is.
