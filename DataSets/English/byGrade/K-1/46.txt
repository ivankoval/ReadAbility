It was Kitten’s first full moon.
When she saw it, she thought.
There’s a little bowl of milk in the sky.
And she wanted it.
So she closed her eyes
and stretched her neck
and opened her mouth and licked.
But Kitten only ended up
with a bug on her tongue.
Poor Kitten!
Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting.
So she pulled herself together
and wiggled her bottom
and sprang from the top step of the porch.
But Kitten only tumbled—
bumping her nose and banging her ear
and pinching her tail.
Poor Kitten!
Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting.
So she chased it—
down the sidewalk,
through the garden,
past the field,
and by the pond.
But Kitten never seemed to get closer.
Poor Kitten!
Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting.
So she ran
to the tallest tree
she could find,
and she climbed
and climbed
and climbed
to the very top.
But Kitten
still couldn’t reach
the bowl of milk,
and now she was
scared.
Poor Kitten!
What could she do?
Then, in the pond, Kitten saw
another bowl of milk.
And it was bigger.
What a night!
So she raced down the tree
and raced through the grass
and raced to the edge of the pond.
She leaped with all her might—
Poor Kitten!
She was wet and sad and tired
and hungry.
So she went
back home—
and there was
a great big
bowl of milk
on the porch,
just waiting for her.
