Agee, Jon. “Two Tree Toads.” Orangutan Tongs. New York: Hyperion, 2009. (2009)
A three-toed tree toad tried to tie
A two-toed tree toad’s shoe.
But tying two-toed shoes is hard
For three-toed toads to do,
Since three-toed shoes each have three toes,
And two-toed shoes have two.
“Please tie my two-toed tree toad shoe!”
The two-toed tree toad cried.
“I tried my best. Now I must go,”
The three-toed tree toad sighed.
The two-toed tree toad’s two-toed shoe,
Alas, remained untied.
