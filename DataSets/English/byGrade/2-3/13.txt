Dickinson, Emily. “Autumn.” The Compete Poems of Emily Dickinson. Boston: Little, Brown, 1960. (1893)
The morns are meeker than they were.
The nuts are getting brown;
The berry’s cheek is plumper,
The rose is out of town.
The maple wears a gayer scarf,
The field a scarlet gown.
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
I’ll put a trinket on.
