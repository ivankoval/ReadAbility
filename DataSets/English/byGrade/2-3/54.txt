In a lonely lighthouse, far from city and town, far from the comfort of friends, lived a kindhearted cat named Pandora.
She had been living in this lighthouse all alone for four long years, and it was beginning to wear. She found herself
sighing long, deep, lonely sighs. She sat on the rocks overlooking the waves far too long. Sometimes her nose got a
sunburn.
And at night, when she tried to read by the lantern light, her mind wandered and she would think for hours on her
childhood when she had friends and company.
Why did Pandora accept this lonely lighthouse life?
Because a lighthouse had once saved her.
