From the Prologue
There was a time once when the earth was still very young, a time some call the oldest days. This was long before
there were any people about to dig parts of it up and cut parts of it off. People came along much later, building their
towns and castles (which nearly always fell down after a while) and plaguing each other with quarrels and supper parties.
The creatures who lived on earth in that early time stayed each in his own place and kept it beautiful. There were
dwarfs in the mountains, woldwellers in the forests, mermaids in the lakes, and, of course, winds in the air.
There was one particular spot on the earth where a ring of mountains enclosed a very dry and dusty place. There
were winds and dwarfs there, but no mermaids because there weren’t any lakes, and there were no woldwellers either
because forests couldn’t grow in so dry a place.
Then a remarkable thing happened. Up in the mountains one day a dwarf was poking about with a sharp tool, looking
for a good spot to begin mining. He poked and poked until he had made a very deep hole in the earth. Then he poked
again and clear spring water came spurting up in the hole. He hurried in great excitement to tell the other dwarfs and
they all came running to see the water. They were so pleased that they built over it a fine house of heavy stones and
they made a special door out of a flat rock and balanced it in its place very carefully on carved hinges. Then one of
them made a whistle out of a small stone which blew a certain very high note tuned to just the right warble so that
when you blew it, the door of the rock house would open, and when you blew it again, the door would shut. They
took turns being in charge of the whistle and they worked hard to keep the spring clean and beautiful.
