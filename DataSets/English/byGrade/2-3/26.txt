From “Welcome to the Global Village”
Earth is a crowded place and it is getting more crowded all the time. As for January 1, 2002 the world’s population
was 6 billion, 200 million—that’s 6,200,000,000. Twenty-three countries have more than fifty million (50,000,000)
people. Ten countries each have more than one hundred million (100,000,000) people. China has nearly one billion,
three hundred million people (1,3000,000,000).
Numbers like this are hard to understand, but what if we imagined the whole population of the world as a village of
just 100 people? In this imaginary village, each person would represent about sixty-two million (62,000,000) people
from the real world.
One hundred people would fit nicely into a small village. By learning about the villagers—who they are and how they
live—perhaps we can find out more about our neighbors in the real world and the problems our planet may face in the
future.
Ready to enter the global village? Go down into the valley and walk through the gates. Dawn is chasing away the
night shadows. The smell of wood smoke hangs in the air. A baby awakes and cries.
Come and meet the people of the global village.
