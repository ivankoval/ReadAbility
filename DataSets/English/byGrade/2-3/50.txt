From “Henry and Mudge”
Every day when Henry woke up, he saw Mudge’s big head. And every day when Mudge woke up, he saw Henry’s
small face.
They ate breakfast at the same time; they ate supper at the same time.
And when Henry was at school, Mudge just lay around and waited. Mudge never went for a walk without Henry again.
And Henry never worried that Mudge would leave.
Because sometimes, in their dreams, they saw long silent roads, big wide fields, deep streams, and pine trees.
In those dreams, Mudge was alone and Henry was alone. So when Mudge woke up and knew Henry was with him, he
remembered the dream and stayed closer.
And when Henry woke up and knew Mudge was with him, he remembered the dream
and the looking
and the calling
and the fear
and he knew he would never lose Mudge again.
