What is better
Than this book
And the churn of candy
In your mouth,
Or the balloon of bubble gum,
Or the crack of sunflower seeds,
Or the swig of soda,
Or the twist of beef jerky,
Or the slow slither
Of snow cone syrup
Running down your arms?
What is better than
This sweet dance
On the tongue,
And this book
That pulls you in?
It yells, “Over here!”
And you hurry along
With a red, sticky face.
