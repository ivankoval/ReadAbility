Light Light
is the ink we use
Night Night
is our parchment
We’re
fireflies
fireflies flickering
flitting
flashing
fireflies
glimmering fireflies
gleaming
glowing
Insect calligraphers Insect calligraphers
practicing penmanship
copying sentences
Six-legged scribblers Six-legged scribblers
of vanishing messages,
fleeting graffiti
Fine artists in flight Fine artists in flight
adding dabs of light
bright brush strokes
Signing the June nights Signing the June nights
as if they were paintings as if they were paintings
We’re
flickering fireflies
fireflies flickering
fireflies. fireflies.
