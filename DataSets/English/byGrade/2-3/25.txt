From “Soap Bubbles”
There are few objects you can make that have both the dazzling beauty and delicate precision of a soap bubble.
Shown here at actual size, this bubble is a nearly perfect sphere. Its shimmering liquid skin is five hundred times thinner
than a human hair.
Bubbles made of plain water break almost as quickly as they form. That’s because surface tension is so strong the
bubbles collapse. Adding soap to water weakens water’s surface tension. This allows a film of soapy water to stretch
and stretch without breaking.
When you blow a bubble, it looks somewhat like a drop of water emerging from a faucet. And just like the surface of
a drop of water, the bubble’s surface shrinks to form a sphere. Spheres and circles are mathematical shapes. Because
they can form spontaneously, they are also shapes of nature.
