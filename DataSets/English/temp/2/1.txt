[SCENE: As curtain rises, we see a divided stage, only the center part of which is lighted and furnished as MRS. STEVENSON’S
bedroom. Expensive, rather fussy furnishings. A large bed, on which MRS. STEVESON, clad in bed-jacket,
is lying. A night-table close by, with phone, lighted lamp, and pill bottles. A mantle, with clock, R. A closed door. R. A
window, with curtains closed, rear. The set is lit by one lamp on night-table. It is enclosed by three flats. Beyond this
central set, the stage, on either side, is in darkness.
MRS. STEVENSON is dialing a number on the phone, as curtain rises. She listens to phone, slams down receiver in irritation.
As she does so, we hear sound of a train roaring by in the distance. She reaches for her pill bottle, pours herself
a glass of water, shakes out pill, swallows it, then reaches for the phone again, dials number nervously.]
SOUND: Number being dialed on phone: Busy signal.
MRS. STEVENSON. (A querulous, self-centered neurotic.) Oh—dear! (Slams down receiver, Dials OPERATOR.)
[Scene: A spotlight, L. of side flat, picks up out of peripheral darkness, figure of 1st OPERATOR, sitting with headphones
at a small table. If spotlight not available, use flashlight, clicked on by 1st OPERATOR, illuminating her face.]
OPERATOR. Your call, please?
MRS. STEVENSON. Operator? I’ve been dialing Murray Hill 4-0098 now for the last three-quarters of an hour, and the
line is always busy. But I don’t see how it could be that busy that long. Will you try it for me please?
OPERATOR. Murray Hill 4-0098? One moment, please.
[SCENE: She makes gesture of plugging in call through switchboard.]
MRS. STEVENSON. I don’t see how it could be busy all this time. It’s my husband’s office. He’s working late tonight,
and I’m all alone.
