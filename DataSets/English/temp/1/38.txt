From Chapter 1
Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn’t go, there lived
a cold aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda. She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was
always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep,
and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or kernels of nuts, or
to tear the wings from nightingales. He was six feet four, and forty-six, and even colder than he thought he was. One
eye wore a velvet patch; the other glittered through a monocle, which made half of his body seem closer to you than
the other half. He had lost one eye when he was twelve, for he was fond of peering into nests and lairs in search of
birds and animals to maul. One afternoon, a mother shrike had mauled him first. His nights were spent in evil dreams,
and his days were given to wicked schemes.
Wickedly scheming, he would limp and cackle through the cold corridors of the castle, planning new impossible
feats for the suitors of Saralinda to perform. He did not wish to give her hand in marriage, since her hand was the
only warm hand in the castle. Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen. They
had all frozen at the same time, on a snowy night, seven years before, and after that it was always ten to five in the
castle. Travelers and mariners would look up at the gloomy castle on the lonely hill and say, “Time lies frozen there. It’s
always Then. It’s never Now.”
