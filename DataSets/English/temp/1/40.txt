From Chapter Three: “Chester”
Tucker Mouse had been watching the Bellinis and listening to what they said. Next to scrounging, eaves-dropping on
human beings was what he enjoyed most. That was one of the reasons he lived in the Times Square subway station.
As soon as the family disappeared, he darted out across the floor and scooted up to the newsstand. At one side
the boards had separated and there was a wide space he could jump through. He’d been in a few times before—just
exploring. For a moment he stood under the three-legged stool, letting his eyes get used to the darkness. Then he
jumped up on it.
“Psst!” he whispered. “Hey, you up there—are you awake?”
There was no answer.
“Psst! Psst! Hey!” Tucker whispered again, louder this time.
From the shelf above came a scuffling, like little feet feeling their way to the edge. “Who is that going ‘psst’?” said a
voice.
“It’s me,” said Tucker. “Down here on the stool.”
A black head, with two shiny black eyes, peered down at him. “Who are you?”
“A mouse,” said Tucker. “Who are you?”
“I’m Chester Cricket, said the cricket. He had a high, musical voice. Everything he said seemed spoken in an unheard
melody.
“My name’s Tucker,” said Tucker Mouse. “Can I come up?”
“I guess so,” said Chester Cricket. “This isn’t my house anyway.”
Tucker jumped up beside the cricket and looked him all over. “A cricket,” he said admiringly. “So you’re a cricket. I
never saw one before.”
I’ve seen mice before,” the cricket said. “I knew quite a few back in Connecticut.”
“Is that where you’re from?” asked Tucker.
“Yes,” said Chester. “I guess I’ll never see it again,” he added wistfully.
